        <h2>Issues with current data management system</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Data is the new most valuable of every organization on the planet. This rapidly increases the need to generate, process and store the data. Datacentres around the world are consuming more energy and producing more greenhouse gases than ever (Zahra, 2014). Since data is such valuable resource, every organization has its own data centre which just increases the energy consumption and carbon footprint. According to the experts at Vertiv, a global provider of critical digital infrastructure and continuity solutions, datacentres are responsible for up to 3% of global energy consumption in 2023 and are projected to touch 4% by 2030. (Law, 2022)They also emit a substantial portion of greenhouse gases.</p>

                    <td>Legal Issue</td>
                    <td>The biggest legal issue with cloud computing is data security and privacy regulations. Cloud service providers handle large amounts of sensitive data. These service providing organizations should follow data regulations and handle data within legal terms. This problem can be countered by navigating and following the data protection regulations and laws to maintain privacy of the users.</td>

                    <td>The biggest ethical issue is accountability. Cloud providers should be held responsible for security and privacy of data. They should also account for their environmental impact and adherence to sustainable practices for a net-zero future.</td>

                    <td>Social Issue</td>
                    <td>The biggest social issue is user trust. Organizations are used to keep their data in physical datacentres which they trusted completely. However, when using cloud services, their data is completely remote and virialized.  Consumers are increasingly concerned about the security and privacy of their organizational data.</td>

                    <td>The biggest professional issue is professional reliability. Cloud providers should be able to provide proper service whenever required by the users. They handle huge amounts of data but should also provide service when needed as data unavailable when needed is useless.</td>
