                    <p>Data is the new most valuable of every organization on the planet. This rapidly increases the need to generate, process and store the data. Data centres around the world are consuming more energy and producing more greenhouse gases than ever (Zahra, 2014). Since data is such a valuable resource, every organization has its own data centre which just increases the energy consumption and carbon footprint. According to the experts at Vertiv, a global provider of critical digital infrastructure and continuity solutions, data centres are responsible for up to 3% of global energy consumption in 2023 and are projected to touch 4% by 2030. (Law, 2022)They also emit a substantial portion of greenhouse gases.</p>

These service providing organizations should follow data regulations and handle data within legal terms. This problem can be countered by navigating and following the data protection regulations and laws to maintain privacy of the users.</td>
