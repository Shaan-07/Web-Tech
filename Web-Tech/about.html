                    <p>Data has become the single most valuable asset in the modern business world. As a lot of news outlets like The Economist have published – “Data is not just the new oil, it is more valuable than oil” (The Economist, 2017). Data centres across the globe contain the most valuable resource available to mankind. The rapid increase in data generation and storage has raised some serious environmental concerns. Green Cloud computing has emerged as a crucial strategy to achieve the goal of a net-zero future. Green cloud computing offers a range of solutions that aim to optimize resource utilization, lower energy consumption, and adapt sustainable practices throughout the cloud computing lifecycle.</p>
                    <h2>History of Cloud Computing</h2>
                    <p>Cloud computing as a concept dates back to the 1950s, but it wasn't until the early 2000s that it gained widespread popularity. The term "cloud computing" was coined in 2006, and since then, it has revolutionized the way businesses manage their data and applications.</p>

                    <h2>What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
                    <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.</p>
                    <h2>Types of Cloud Computing</h2>
                    <p>There are three main types of cloud computing:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong> Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.</li>
                        <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> Delivers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need to install and run the application on the customer's own computers or data centers.</li>
                    </ul>
