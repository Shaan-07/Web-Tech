                    <h2>The advantages of Cloud Computing</h2>
                    <p><strong>Reduce energy usage:</strong> An organization needs a constant power supply to operate an on-site datacenter. They also need an active cooling system to counter overheating and when the equipment is no longer usable, that creates e-waste. However, cloud computing reduces these numbers significantly. Research funded by Google and conducted by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in collaboration with Northwestern University found that switching common software applications to the cloud would drop energy usage by 87% (AgileIT, 2023).</p>
                    <p><strong>Decrease greenhouse gas emissions:</strong> A normal on-site datacenter produces far more greenhouse gases than its cloud alternative. Cloud decreases the rate of carbon emissions by reducing energy requirement and consumption. A survey conducted by WSP and Accenture showed that green cloud computing has a considerable effect on carbon emissions. It showed that by using cloud technology, large companies can lessen carbon footprint by 30% (AgileIT, 2023).</p>
                    <p><strong>Dematerialization:</strong> It means to replace the physical high-carbon products with virtual alternatives. Cloud computing removes the need for separate on-site data center for each organization. Instead, they can opt for suitable cloud services to reduce their carbon footprint and cost. Cloud computing also enables organizations to go paperless which also provides more security.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reduce E-Waste production:</strong> Cloud computing provides all services virtually. This enables organizations to use cloud servers and database instead of building their own datacenters which results in need for less equipment. This development directly reduces E-waste resulting in contribution towards a net-zero future.</p>
